As an enthusiastic observer of our fast-changing, revolutionary world, I felt that if I didn’t learn technology, I’d struggle to keep pace with it. Sure, I could have simply watched tech news to stay updated, but I wanted to go beyond the headlines — to get inside it, understand it deeply, and explore it right down to its roots.",

      "When COVID struck, I decided not to switch schools and continued in the same one. The first two semesters were entirely online — I attended every class, but often from under my blanket, half-asleep :p. This was also the time I got my first smartphone :D Maths was boring, but I managed to cope with it well — something I’m still proud of. Physics quickly became my favorite subject, while chemistry was my least favorite. My elective was economics… and to this day, I’m not sure why I chose it.Then came another COVID wave, which unfortunately caught up with me, making me a bit sick and slightly affecting my exams :( .",
      "Still, I made some amazing friends, shared great moments, and we even managed to organize a farewell to properly say goodbye to all our teachers.Those two years were tough and challenging, but they turned out to be a meaningful learning journey one I’ll carry with me for the rest of my life."
