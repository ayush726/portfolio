# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- Make sure you have a Vercel account
- Your project should be pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your Git repository
4. Select the repository containing this project

### 2. Configure Build Settings
Vercel will automatically detect this as a Vite project, but ensure these settings:

- **Framework Preset**: Vite
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

### 3. Environment Variables (if needed)
If you have any environment variables, add them in the Vercel dashboard under Project Settings > Environment Variables.

### 4. Deploy
Click "Deploy" and wait for the build to complete.

## What Was Fixed

The following issues were resolved to ensure successful deployment:

1. **Removed GitHub Pages configuration** - The `homepage` field and GitHub Pages deployment scripts were removed from `package.json`
2. **Fixed Vite configuration** - Added proper `base: "/"` and build optimization
3. **Added Vercel configuration** - Created `vercel.json` with proper routing rules for React Router
4. **Fixed site configuration** - Changed `baseUrl` from absolute URL to relative path
5. **Updated .gitignore** - Added proper build output exclusions

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see a blank page:
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify that all assets are loading correctly
3. Ensure the `vercel.json` file is in your repository root
4. Check that the build command completes successfully

### Common Issues:
- **404 errors on routes**: Make sure `vercel.json` is properly configured
- **Build failures**: Check that all dependencies are properly installed
- **Asset loading issues**: Verify the `base` path in `vite.config.ts` is set to `"/"`

## Testing Locally

Before deploying, test the production build locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

This will serve the built files locally and help identify any issues before deployment.

## Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when:
- The build completes without errors
- Your homepage loads correctly
- Navigation between routes works
- All assets (images, CSS, JS) load properly
- No console errors in the browser
